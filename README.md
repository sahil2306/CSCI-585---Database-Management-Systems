# CSCI-585---Database-Management-Systems

## 1: EER Diagram
Create a conceptual (Extended) Entity-Relational [ie. (E)ER] diagram, to model a scenario; It has everything - entities and relationships, and use the (E)ER notation for supertypes/subtypes.

## 2: SQL
Creation of relational tables, and writing queries that will make use of the data.

There are 6 questions below to queries to answer these questions.
Q1. Find the sponsor who has sponsored the highest amount in YouTube. Display the sponsor’s name, phone number and the total amount sponsored.
Q2. Find the ratio of likes to views of each video belonging to any of the channels owned by users having the word “Marvel Entertainment” in them. Display the Video Title, channel name and the ratio in the ascending order of the title.
Q3. Find unique user/s with the total number of paid subscribers greater than 100 for their channel/s created on 01.01.2023. Display the username, email, channel name and the subscriber count.
Q4. Find the average sentiment score for each keyword category. Display the keyword name along with average score such that the highest score is displayed first.
Q5. Find the minimum and maximum age of viewers who watched the most commented on video on Taylor Swift’s channel. Display the video title, minimum age and the maximum age.
Q6. Find all the content creators living in the US who have consistently posted at least 1 video each week of the last month. Display their username, channel/s they own and their total subscriber count.

## 3: Geospatial data handling
Working with spatial data - Got spatial data, visualized it, did queries, and visualize the query results.

## 4: NoSQL
Queries to answer the following things:
1) Write a (simple!) query to output locations (documents) with a popularity of >=50. Take a screenshot of the query and results.
2) Visualize your 12 locations (ie the HW3Data collection), take a screenshot. To visualize (create a chart), you'd pick a chart type, then drag and drop document columns (keys) on to the chart's slots
3) Write a query (in the chart area) where you would specify a bounding box (lower-left location, upper-right location) to display just the northern half of your 12 locations. Take a screenshot of the query and the result.
4) Bring your Spirograph data into a new map
5) Specify a triangle (three locations) to display just the Spiro coords inside your triangle. Take a screenshot of the query and result (this is a cool capability, to bound spatial search results by specifying an arbitrary polygon).
6) Bring in all the national parks into another map - cool! All 396 are visible, on a map of the entire US. Write a query to output just the western half locations (west of the Rockies). Create a bounding box to do this (like in Q3). Take a screenshot.

## 5: ML
Using data to predict things!
Using different models to classify cats and dogs in the browser.
